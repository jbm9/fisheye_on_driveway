fisheye_on_driveway
===================

Another OpenSCAD quickie: a new housing for a little cheapy webcam,
including a mounting point for a cheap phonecamera fisheye lens.  The
piece is designed to be fit together with a couple of M4x20mm bolts,
then screwed down to a wall.

There are three pieces:

The mounting plate, with slots for the nuts and holes for the screws

The main body, with a hole for the USB cable and lens mounting aperture

The lens coupler, which sits inside the main body.
